This program is designed to accept a string input to return an acronym. For example, if
the user inputs "Laugh out loud", the program outputs "LOL". The program can also take
a hyphenated string and treat it as two words. For example, if the user inputs
"Liquid-crystal display", the program outputs "LCD".
